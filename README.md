# Sorting-Algorithm-Visualizer
This is a responsive web app created with React and Javascript, that provides graphical representations of common sorting algorithms. My goal is to make sorting algorithms more intuitive and comprehensible for different types of learners.

# Features
- User control over animation speed
- User control over array size
- Intuitive descriptions and runtime analysis included

# Future Plans
This project is still a work in progress. I would like to add more sorting algorithms, as well as improve the animations, and add additional features soon!
